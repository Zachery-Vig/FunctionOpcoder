# FunctionOpcoder
A Simple Program for Representing Functions as Opcodes in Python

What is it and Why?
FunctionOpcoder is a small program I wrote for python3 that works by taking a list of opcodes and parameters
and using a specified list, represent those opcodes as functions.
Primarly intended for small file size representing for programs with large amounts of functions.
